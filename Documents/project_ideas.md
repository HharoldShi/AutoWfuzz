## Fuzzing with genetic algorithms

- Novelty: new file formats or improve genetic algorithm

- (paper to check) https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/1347/ 

- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257925221_Fuzz_in_the_Dark_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Black-Box_Fuzzing

## Grammar-based fuzzing 

- Novelty: write a parser and mutator
	
- Autofuzz: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~sgorbuno/publications/autofuzz.pdf (paper to check)
	
- GANFuzz: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3203217.3203241?download=true
  
- Automated learning of protocol rules: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/papers/jpgn_iaai_2019/ (might be too comlicated)
